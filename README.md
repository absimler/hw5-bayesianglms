Homework \#5: Bayesian GLMMs with brms
================

In this homework, we will be returning to some 
familiar datasets for an assignment that has a slightly 
different structure than our past ones! The goal of this
assignment is to practice interpretation of Bayesian glms,
by returning to one of our past homework
questions (which were fit using frequentist glms) and
re-doing the prompt using Bayesian glms in brms instead!

You can choose from any of the following questions to
"redo":
Homework 3, Question 2: Responses of insectivorous bats to urbanization
Homework 4, Question 1: Impacts of mistletoe infection in Spanish forests
Homework 4, Question 2: Fire effects following forest thinning


Choose ONE question to 'redo' and convert your past analysis 
to fit your glm using brms instead. Please complete all steps in the 
question (HW 3, #2; HW 4, #1; OR HW 4, #2) as it was previously written.

The only changes are that you will fit your glm in brms and that you 
should update your answer to include:
1) an interpretation of the evidence for or against the research
hypothesis, based on the probability of direction of the coefficient
of interest (rather than a p-value).
2) an interpretation of the effect size, using the median or mean 
of the posterior.
3) a diagnosis of model fit, using both a numeric metric (MAE/RMSE/R2)
and a visual posterior predictive check.
4) an updated marginal effects plot.

You may choose whichever question you'd like, and only ONE question
is required.

If you would like to complete more than one of the questions listed 
above, I will issue a regrade for your previous score on one of 
the questions (just indicate which of the two answers you'd like a regrade 
for).

This repository is a blank template. Please add your answers to the
HW5_answers.R file, and be sure to add the required datasets to this
repository (which is good practice!)
